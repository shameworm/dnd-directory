You gain the 1st-level hit points for a class only when you are a 1st-level character.You add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form your pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you can simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the paladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have ten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different types, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric 5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice."

You gain additional uses only when you reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For example, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel Divinity twice between rests, because you are high enough level in the cleric class to have more uses.

As a 3rd-level wizard, you know three wizard cantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of which (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard) can be 2nd-level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare six wizard spells from your spellbook.Each spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your classes, and you use that class's spellcasting ability when you cast the spell.

Use this total to determine your spell slots by consulting the table below.The resulting slots may be of a level you don't actually have any spells for. You can use those slots to cast lower-level spells. If a lower-level spell you cast, like burning hands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher-level slot, you can use the enhanced effect, even though you don't have any spells of that higher level.For example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you count as a 5th-level character for determining your spell slots: you have four 1st-level slots, three 2nd-level slots, and two 3rd-level slots. However, you don't know any 3rd-level spells, nor do you know any 2nd-level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of those levels to cast the spells you do know -- and potentially enhance their effects."
